## Harness CLI

The Rust Harness CLI is the primary interface for the durable layer. Installed
projects use the prebuilt binary at `scripts/bin/harness-cli` on macOS/Linux or
`scripts/bin/harness-cli.exe` on Windows for normal Harness work.

```bash
scripts/bin/harness-cli init
scripts/bin/harness-cli intake ...
scripts/bin/harness-cli story ...
scripts/bin/harness-cli story update --id US-001 --unit 1 --integration 1 --e2e 0 --platform 0
scripts/bin/harness-cli story verify US-001
scripts/bin/harness-cli decision ...
scripts/bin/harness-cli backlog ...
scripts/bin/harness-cli trace ...
scripts/bin/harness-cli score-trace
scripts/bin/harness-cli query matrix
scripts/bin/harness-cli query matrix --numeric
scripts/bin/harness-cli migrate
scripts/bin/harness-cli --version
```

On Windows, use the same commands through:

```powershell
.\scripts\bin\harness-cli.exe
```

Proof flags on `story update` are numeric booleans: use `1` for yes and `0` for
no. `story verify <id>` runs the configured `verify_command`; it does not accept
proof flags. Configure the command with `story add/update --verify`, run
`story verify <id>`, then update proof flags with `story update`.

Backlog `--risk` uses Harness lanes, not severity words: use `tiny`, `normal`,
or `high-risk`. Use `tiny` instead of `low`. `query matrix` defaults to
human-readable `yes`/`no`; use `query matrix --numeric` when copying values into
`story update`.

The schema lives in `scripts/schema/` and is version-controlled. The database
file (`harness.db`) is `.gitignore`d.
